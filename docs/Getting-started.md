Welcome to Quests! This wiki should help you with creating your own custom quests on your server.

### What is a quest?
A **quest** is simply a **group of tasks** which a player must complete in return for a reward.

Each **task** may have a different **task type**, which range from breaking blocks to reaching a certain position in the world. Quests provides over 30 different types you can use, listed on [this page](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests/wiki/Task-Types).
