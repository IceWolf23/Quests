The '''quests debugger''' allows you to see why a quest may not be working as intended. When turned on for a quest, it will print out what a task type is doing and how it is evaluating it. This can be helpful to see why a specific quest is not accepting a specific action.

== Using the debugger ==

The debugger can be enabled with '''/q a debug quest <nowiki><quest/*> <all/self></nowiki>'''. Using * in place of <nowiki><quest></nowiki> will enable it for all quests. Enabling it for all will show debug logs for every player, whereas self will show it for just yourself.

== Example ==

We may want to debug the following task:

```yaml
tasks:
  mining:
    type: "blockbreakcertain"
    amount: 30
    blocks:
    - DARK_OAK_LOG
    - DARK_OAK_PLANKS
    reverse-if-placed: false
```

When breaking PACKED_ICE, the debugger sends this output:

Here it is telling us that the task type is checking the broken block against all the blocks in the <code>blocks</code> list, and not finding a match, thus skipping this task.

Now, when breaking DARK_OAK_PLANKS:

The debugger tells us that it finds a match and increments the task progress.

This can be useful when trying to work out why a task may not be working, such as in the case where you think you're breaking a block of a specific type, but in reality it has a different type.
